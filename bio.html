          <h1>Bio: A brief intro about me</h1>
          <p>
            I graduated from Portland State University in March of 2020 with a
            B.S. in Computer Science, Magna Cum Laude. Currently, I am looking
            for a full-time position as a Software Developer. I am eager to
            learn and try out new things, am always a team player, strives to do
            my best, and am never afraid to ask questions. If I do not
            understand something or am stuck, I will try my best to figure it
            out, but I won't hesitate to seek help from my fellow collegues if I
            can.

          <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
          <p>
            Although I do not have much professional working experience, I have
            experience in the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Languages: C++, C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
              ...
            </li>
            <li>
              Systems/Frameworks: Linux/Unix, Node, React, Django, MongoDB,
              Bootstrap ...
            </li>
            <li>
              Tools: Github, VS Code, IntelliJ, Xcode, Android Studio, Postman
              ...
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I am most experienced in creating programs in Linux/Unix with
            languages such as C++ and Java. I have recently been involved in
            projects pertaining to web app development and databases, and enjoy
            learning about game development, but I am also interested in
            exploring about other types of software development.

          <h1>Goals</h1>
          <p>
            At the moment, my goals are to find a job that I will enjoy doing. A
            working environment that fosters growth, creativity, and pride in
            what we do. Because I know that I am not perfect, and that there is
            much for me to learn, I want to gain the necessary skills and
            experience that will take me further and open up new possibilities.
            I want to be challenged to do better and be better. I want to
            contribute to projects that either help others or bring joy to them.
            Useful technologies that we enjoy making and others enjoy using.
